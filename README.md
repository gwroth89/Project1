Marijuana and Crime

The aim of this project is to discover whether or not there is a correlation between the usage of marijuana and crime 

as well as not being a project about Covid.  

Within this, our group is focusing on whether the status of marijuana (fully illegal, fully legal, and decriminalized/medicinal only) 

has an impact on violent and non-violent crime and whether or not marijuanaâ€™s status is indicative of a rise of crime or 

if states that legalize follow the national trend in regards to crime rate.


Databases we used included the FBI Crime Database which is callable via API as well as the Offense Data & Arrest Data controllers within the API Census.

Questions we asked were whether or not there was a change in crime when legalization occured, whether or non there was an impact on type of crime being committed,

and was there a difference in crime by legalization status.

In regards to limitations, we found that the big factors limiting the scope of this revolved areound it being optional to report crime statistics until 1979,

the lack of coordination between local police departments and the FBI, and the fact that marijuana has only been legalized in any American jurisdiction since 2012.

Those who worked on this project are Greg Roth, Lindsey Wolterstorff, Art Rogers, Taylor Marino, and Will Dickerson.
