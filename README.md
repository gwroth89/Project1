# Project1

We  want to analyze the impact of Marijuana legalization on crime rates in states that have
legalized in comparison to states that have not. 

We plan to use the FBI Crime Database which is callable via API.
    Offense Data & Arrest Data controllers within the API
Census may be needed to supplement population data


Was there a change in crime rates prior to legalization vs post legalization in states that legalized?
    Were crime rates stable across states that have maintained illegality?

Was there an impact on rates across differing types of crime (Property vs. Violent)?

Is there a difference in crime by legalization status (fully legal, mixed/decriminalized/medical, not legal)?

Is there a relationship between population growth and legalization status?
    do states with less population growth have more restrictive cannabis laws (& vice versa)?


Limitations of the data set - relies on PDs to report who may or may not report to the FBI.
