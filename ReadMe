Marijuana and Crime

The aim of this project is to discover whether or not there is a correlation between the usage of marijuana and crime 
as well as not being a project about Covid.  
Within this, our group is focusing on whether the status of marijuana (fully illegal, fully legal, and medicinal only) 
has an impact on violent and non-violent crime and whether or not marijuanaâ€™s status is indicative of a rise of crime or 
if states that legalize follow the national trend in regards to crime rate.
Those who worked on this project are Greg Roth, Lindsey Wolterstorff, Art Rogers, Taylor Marino, and Will Dickerson.
